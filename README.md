# Wellington Night Market UX Design Formative

## Getting Started
Download or fork this project to work on it on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
The only third party piece of software used is Koala as a SASS to CSS converter. Have this set up so it sends the compiled CSS file to the /css directory and is named style.css.

## Frameworks Used

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) - Front end framework used (v3.3.7)
* [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/7.0.0/normalize.css) - CSS Reset Framework (v7.0.0)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) - JS Framework (v3.2.1)
